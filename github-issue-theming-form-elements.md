# [task] Apply theming to form labels

## Description

Currently, theming has been applied to text field form elements, but form labels throughout the workspace management interface still need consistent theming applied. Form labels are critical for accessibility and user experience, and they should have consistent styling that aligns with the overall design system.

The goal is to ensure all form labels have consistent typography, color, spacing, and visual hierarchy that provides a cohesive user experience across all forms in the application.
