## What is Kubeflow Notebooks?

Key features of Kubeflow Notebooks:

- Native support for [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio), and [Visual Studio Code (code-server)](https://github.com/coder/code-server).
- Users can [create notebook containers](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/quickstart-guide/) directly in the cluster, rather than locally on their workstations.
- Admins can provide [standard notebook images](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/container-images/) for their organization with required packages pre-installed.
- Access control is managed by [Kubeflow’s RBAC](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/profiles/), enabling easier notebook sharing across the organization.

## Installation
