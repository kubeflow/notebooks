# Caching: We want the browser to always check if the index.html file it has
# is the latest one. Also we want this check to use the ETag header and not
# the Last-Modified since our app will be served inside a container and we
# might want to roll-back.
# The JS/CSS files will have a hash in their name and thus we will want to
# cache them for as long as possible
